# scrycli

## Installation
Install through pip with `pip install scrycli`.
Do note that this currently only works with python 3.6 and newer.

I personally recommand to also add `alias scry="scrycli search"` to make
searching extra easy.

## Todo
* Better error messages
* Support for non-tty (no italics for flavor text)
* Support for different output formats (start is already in \_\_main\_\_.py)
* `show` command that always only returns single card (otherwise errors)
  * automatically see if gatherer id, and only if not use the name
  * option to open in browser
* option to show links
* support python 3.4 and newer
* list sets, list cards in set
* sorting for search
