# scrycli
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PolarPayne/scrycli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PolarPayne/scrycli)

## Installation
Install through pip with `pip install scrycli`.
Should work with python 3.4 and newer.

I personally recommend to also add `alias scry="scrycli search"` to make
searching extra easy.

## Todo
* Better error messages
* Support for different output formats (start is already in \_\_main\_\_.py)
* list sets, list cards in set
